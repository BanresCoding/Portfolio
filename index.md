# Welcome!
I am a student at Sheffield Hallam University in my second year studying Game Design and Development. My goal is to join an industry of creators eager to create and share meaningful experiences. In this page, you can find some of my recent projects and university work.

## Twisty Junction
Twisty Junction is a 2-4 player board game where players compete to construct roads and connect towns, whilst also sabotaging their opponents with obstructions throughout the game. This boardgame is the culmination of my 'Physical Games' module at Sheffield Hallam, and has strengthened my ability to document and explain changes that I have made to the game.

## The Exhibition Heist
The Exhibition Heist is a series of prototypes made in Bitsy and Unity for my 'Experimental Games Practice' module, which has pushed us to consider more ways of telling stories and worldbuilding. This series of games follows an art heist at the gallery of a revered artist. The finished game would alternate between the heister and the artist's emotional state in the story, where the player controls the heister in the gallery acting as the hub world, and the artist's paintings being the levels the player must traverse. By telling the story through these paintings, the game's mechanics would be able to shift depending on the painting the player has chosen.

## Ratrio
Ratrio is a roguelike game made for a group project in my first year at Sheffield Hallam. As a team of six(two artists, designers and programmers), we collaborated to create a game that tasked the player to manage their resources and defeat hordes of enemies to save the protagonist's daughter. My role in this project was to design the game mechanics, as well as how individual levels would appear when spawned in gameplay. Through this project, I built up my communication and time management skills by organising the team's weekly scrum meetings and setting goals to complete for each member of the team on a Trello board.
