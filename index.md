## About me
Welcome!

I am a sixth form student from the United Kingdom with an aspiration for coding.
Below is some of my work

# Cosmic Incursion
## About the Game:  
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/ahyeas.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Cosmic Incurion is a game I have been working on for my OCR A-Level Computer Science coursework. It is a tower defense game which takes inspiration from games like Bloons and Infinitode to make a unique blend of the tower defence genre. In the game, the player will have to adapt to enemies that change their strategies to counter the player's defences. Over the course of this project, I have utilised Dijkstra's algorithm for enemy pathfinding and used it to provide more variety to the main gameplay loop, for example, giving a specific enemy type the ability to take the most optimised path on a given level.

# Trials 64
## About the Game:
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/newcover.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Trials 64 is a dirtbike game initially made as a development jam submission for a competition I took part in during early 2021. After getting acquainted with the 3D Unity environment, I continued to work on the game after the week long development period to bring it to a more complete state. In the game, the player has to drive their dirtbike from one end of the course to the other in as little time as possible. By taking inspiration from games in the Trials series, I was able to create levels that offered interesting gameplay and decisions when working towards high scores.

# Arcane Ascent
## About the Game:
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/ArcaneIcon.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Arcane Ascent is an adventure platformer made for a development jam submission in under 48 hours in late 2021. In the game, the player controls a magical wizard with the objective to climb a rural hillside while defeating fantasy enemies and solving puzzles. Over the development process, I improved my thought process and how I design my games, by brainstorming more options before committing to a final idea.

# Swinging to the Rhythm
## About the Game:
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/icon.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Swinging to the Rhythm is a minigolf game again made for a development jam in under 48 hours in mid 2021. In the game, the player has to get the lowest score possible on the course I have created, and tasked to collect keys across the levels to access the ends to the holes.
