# Welcome!
I am a student at Sheffield Hallam University in my second year studying Game Design and Development. My goal is to join an industry of creators eager to create and share meaningful experiences. In this page, you can find some of my recent projects and university work.

# Twisty Junction
Twisty Junction is a 2-4 player board game where players compete to construct roads and connect towns, whilst also sabotaging their opponents with obstructions throughout the game. This boardgame is the culmination of my 'Physical Games' module at Sheffield Hallam, and has strengthened my ability to document and explain changes that I have made to the game. you can download the rule book for the game <a href="/Portfolio/RulebookV2.pdf">here</a>.

# The Exhibition Heist
The Exhibition Heist is a series of prototypes made in Bitsy and Unity for my 'Experimental Games Practice' module, which has pushed us to consider more ways of telling stories and worldbuilding. This series of games follows an art heist at the gallery of a revered artist. The finished game would alternate between the heister and the artist's emotional state in the story, where the player controls the heister in the gallery acting as the hub world, and the artist's paintings being the levels the player must traverse. By telling the story through these paintings, the game's mechanics would be able to shift depending on the painting the player has chosen.

<img src="/Portfolio/Images/ArcaneIcon.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Arcane Ascent is an adventure platformer made for a development jam submission in under 48 hours in late 2021. In the game, the player controls a magical wizard with the objective to climb a rural hillside while defeating fantasy enemies and solving puzzles. Over the development process, I improved my thought process and how I design my games, by brainstorming more options before committing to a final idea.

Swinging to the Rhythm is a minigolf game again made for a development jam in under 48 hours in mid 2021. In the game, the player has to get the lowest score possible on the course I have created, and tasked to collect keys across the levels to access the ends to the holes.
