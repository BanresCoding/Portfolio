# Welcome!
I am a student at Sheffield Hallam University in my second year studying Game Design and Development. My goal is to join an industry of creators eager to create and share meaningful experiences. In this page, you can find some of my recent projects and university work.

# Twisty Junction
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/ahyeas.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Twisty Junction is a 2-4 player board game where players compete to construct roads and connect towns, whilst also sabotaging their opponents with obstructions throughout the game. This boardgame is the culmination of my 'Physical Games' module at Sheffield Hallam, and has strengthened my ability to document and explain changes that I have made to the game. you can download the rule book for the game <a href="/Portfolio/RulebookV2.pdf">here</a>.

# Trials 64
## About the Game:
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/newcover.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Trials 64 is a dirtbike game initially made as a development jam submission for a competition I took part in during early 2021. After getting acquainted with the 3D Unity environment, I continued to work on the game after the week long development period to bring it to a more complete state. In the game, the player has to drive their dirtbike from one end of the course to the other in as little time as possible. By taking inspiration from games in the Trials series, I was able to create levels that offered interesting gameplay and decisions when working towards high scores.

# Arcane Ascent
## About the Game:
<img src="/Portfolio/Images/ArcaneIcon.PNG" width="20%" align="right" style="padding-left: 15px;">
Arcane Ascent is an adventure platformer made for a development jam submission in under 48 hours in late 2021. In the game, the player controls a magical wizard with the objective to climb a rural hillside while defeating fantasy enemies and solving puzzles. Over the development process, I improved my thought process and how I design my games, by brainstorming more options before committing to a final idea.
