Welcome!

I am a sixth form student from the United Kingdom with an aspiration for coding.
Below is some of my work

### About the Game:  
Cosmic Incurion is a game I have been working on for my OCR A-Level Computer Science coursework. It is a tower defense game which takes inspiration from games like Bloons and Infinitode to make a unique blend of the tower defence genre. In the game, the player will have to adapt to enemies that change their strategies to counter the player's defences. Over the course of this project, I have utilised Dijkstra's algorithm for enemy pathfinding, and used it to provide more variety to the main gameplay loop, giving a specific enemy type, for example, the ability to take the most optimised path on a given level.
